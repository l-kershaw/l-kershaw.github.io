Backend software developer at Acturis Ltd writing reliable, scalable code.
Experienced in problem solving across research and industry using programming and data science.
Highly organised and able to work effectively in a team or individually.

From 2019 to 2023 I studied for a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Bristol.
My PhD research focuses on homological algebra and the representation theory of special biserial algebras,
working under the supervision of [Professor Jeremy Rickard](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majcr/).
My thesis is available [here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/finitely-generated-modules-over-special-biserial-algebras).

I also contribute to some open source projects (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/l-kershaw)).
