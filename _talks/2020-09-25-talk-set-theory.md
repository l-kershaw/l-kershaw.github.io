A brief introduction to the mathematical structure of the card game SET®.

A talk for MINGLE 2020, a social conference for new maths PhD students at University of Bristol.

## Summary
1. Introduce the card game SET® and its rules.
2. Encode SET® cards as a vector space, and SETs as lines in the vector space.
3. Generalise SET® to other dimensions.
4. Introduce \\(d\\)-caps and their correspondence in SET®.
