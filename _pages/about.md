Current final year PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Bristol.
Using custom developed software for data generation and hypothesis testing to research representation theory.
Experienced in problem solving across research and industry using programming and data science.
Highly organised and able to work effectively in a team or individually.
Looking for software development roles.

My PhD research focuses on homological algebra and the representation theory of special biserial algebras,
working under the supervision of [Professor Jeremy Rickard](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majcr/).

Outside of my research, I contribute to some open source projects (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/l-kershaw)) and play canoe polo.
