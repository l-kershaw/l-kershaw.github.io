I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematics, at the University of Bristol, UK.
My research focuses on homological algebra and the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras,
working under the supervision of [Professor Jeremy Rickard](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majcr/). 

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Warwick in 2019, graduating with a First in the integrated Masters Mathematics (MMath) course.
My dissertation focused on Tropical Geometry, supervised by [Professor Diane Maclagan](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/D.Maclagan/).

Outside of my work, I play canoe polo and enjoy cycling.
